# Abstract


## In the pursuit of merging privacy and machine learning, 
we propose the design of a system focusing on the integration of
differential privacy (DP) into the ML training pipeline. This
encompasses evaluations of modules for data pre-processing,
DP-enabled training, and evaluation. Our experiments are
set to analyze the trade-offs between model accuracy and
privacy, measure potential information leakages, and evaluate
the computational overhead introduced by DP
